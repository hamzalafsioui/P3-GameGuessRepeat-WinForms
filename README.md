# P3-GameGuessRepeat

This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in C# using Windows Forms. It challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a limited time frame while providing feedback on their guesses. The game keeps track of correct and incorrect answers, allowing players to play multiple rounds and view their final results.

## Key Features:

* Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between a specified range for each round, adding variability and challenge to each playthrough.
* Feedback Mechanism: Players receive instant feedback on their guesses, with visual cues (such as icons) indicating whether their guess was correct or incorrect.
* Timer: A timer feature adds urgency to the game, requiring players to make quick decisions within a time limit.
* Round-Based Gameplay: Players can play multiple rounds, with the game tracking their correct and incorrect answers throughout the session.
* User Interaction: The game utilizes buttons, text boxes, and visual elements to create an interactive and engaging user experience.
